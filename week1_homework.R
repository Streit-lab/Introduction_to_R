# so this week we went through setting variables. making vectors, matrices and dataframes. Here are a few questions for you to work your way through.
# I don't want the answers - I want you to provide the code which I can use to get the answers. They are tricky and might require you to google a bit,
# but it's not supposed to be easy so spend some time doing these and we can recap next week.

# Good luck!

# task 1: make a character vector named my_vector containing 5 elements

# task 2: make a matrix containing numbers 1:100 split across 10 columns

# Here is a test dataframe I have created from the metadata for my 10x scRNSseq data
test <- read.csv("./test_data/week1_homework_scRNAseq_test.csv")

# task 3: how many columns does the dataframe have?

# task 4: how many cells are female? Hint: you can use sum and the boolean operator to count TRUE values i.e. sum(x %in% y)

# task 5: subset the rows which are male

# task 6: subset a vector of the cell_IDs which are from stage hh4 (orig.ident column)
